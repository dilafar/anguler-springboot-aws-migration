# Full CI/CD pipelines for employee management application, a Java-based dynamic web application with a database.

## Overview

This project is a full-stack Employee Management System developed using **Spring Boot** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend. It follows **DevSecOps** principles and is deployed on **AWS** using Kubernetes.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

### Backend

- **Spring Boot** (REST API)
- **MySQL** (AWS RDS)
- **Maven** (Build tool)

### Frontend

- **Angular** (UI Framework)

### DevOps Tools

- **CI/CD & Configuration Management**: Jenkins, Ansible, GitHub
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Kubernetes, Helm, Kustomize, Docker, Docker Compose
- **Security & Compliance**: Cosign, HashiCorp Vault, TruffleHog, Checkstyle, NodeJsScan, SonarQube, Semgrep, Trivy, Kubescape, Hadolint, Retire.js, Maven Dependency Check, OWASP ZAP, Open Policy Agent (OPA), DefectDojo
- **Artifact & Dependency Management**: Nexus Repository, Maven, ArtifactHub
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Prometheus, Grafana, Alert Manager
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Terraform
- **Continuous Deployment & GitOps**: ArgoCD

### AWS Services Used

- **Networking & Load Balancing**: ALB, Route 53, AWS Certificate Manager, VPC
- **Compute & Container Management**: Amazon EKS, Amazon EC2
- **Storage & Secrets Management**: AWS RDS (MySQL), AWS Secrets Manager, AWS S3 Bucket
- **Container Registry & CDN**: Amazon ECR, Amazon CloudFront

### AWS Load Balancer Controller Installation
#### To install the AWS Load Balancer Controller:

- An IAM policy was created to grant the necessary permissions.
- An IAM service account was created and linked to the policy.
- The AWS Load Balancer Controller was installed using Helm, utilizing the created service account.

### Domain & DNS Management

- The domain was registered on Google Cloud and hosted on AWS Route 53.
- Kubernetes ExternalDNS was used to manage DNS records dynamically, ensuring a cloud-agnostic approach.
- To handle Route 53 access, an IAM policy and IAM service account were created, assigning the necessary IAM role to the Kubernetes service account.
- The ExternalDNS deployment was configured with the service account, allowing DNS record management through Kubernetes ingress or service resources.
- Since the application uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB), ExternalDNS manages DNS records via Kubernetes ingress resources.
- TLS certificates were provisioned using AWS Certificate Manager, ensuring secure HTTPS connections through Kubernetes ingress resources.
